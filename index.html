<h2 id="Canvas">Next Semester's Canvas</h2><hr>
<p>Now is the time to begin thinking about next semester's Canvas presence! Whether you are interested in Canvas as a simple method of exchange or a virtual presence to extend the classroom experience for your students, either goal requires adequate planning as well as important design considerations as you prepare to deploy your next semester’s course.</p>
<h3>Begin with the end in mind:</h3>
<p>Steven Covey's touchstone reminder is a great place to start as you prepare to build your course.  What are your course objectives?  Are there Power Standards identified for your course?  Including these learning goals as part of your Canvas presence provides students with targets that they can aim for as they learn. A simple statement either of raw formal state standards or softened student language standards can provide them with an end that will guide their work.  I like to provide them in a reminder page for each weekly module.</p>
<h3>Organize, organize, organize</h3>
<p>A key concept in creating a Canvas presence is to organize materials so that you and your students can easily navigate the course.  This could come in the form of unit or topic modules that have further organization within each module with text headers, but an even better schematic for high schoolers is to organize by date. </p>
<p>Ideally, a module for each week can help students understand where they are in the course, but weeks can additionally be organized within each module using a separate text header for each day.  As an alternative, one could also organize each week by the type of resources that are available.  In this scenario, each week's module could be further organized with text headers that divide the module into categories like learning resources, assignments, and quizzes.  This organization will not only help your students navigate your course, but it can help you as you communicate with your students about specific resources in your course.  See this Instructure Community help article for more on how to organize using text headers.  </p>

<h3>Help!  Help! Help!  </h3>
<p>Don't forget Instructure’s Community Help pages!  In addition to helping you create incredible Canvas courses, these resources can help your students complete the tasks that you design for them.  Navigating Canvas is complicated, and it is amazing how helpful these articles are.  As an example, I try to always provide a link to the help article dealing with annotating resources when I have assignments that require students to use that feature.  It is much easier to initially direct them to that link than to explain this complicated task. There is always opportunity to follow up if the task still eludes them.  Instructure's Help Community is accessible through the link in the blue global navigation bar of your Canvas instance.</p>
<h3>There Be Dragons Here</h3>
<p>Looking for different ways to present information?  Want to spruce up the visual appeal of your pages and assignments?   Interested in incorporating tabs or accordion dropdowns in your content?  Want to use a hanging indent on text? Looking for something to fill time that would otherwise be spent on social media? You can do all of this and more with HTML.  Click the </> symbol in the lower right corner of the Canvas WYSIWYG editor to view the HTML mode of your current page or assignment.  Google is your friend on this!  There are a number of video and traditional tutorials on the web that will walk you through setting up your content with some cool features. Don’t forget Instructure’s Help Community!  </p>
<h3>Can I Get Started Now?</h3>
<p>Definitely!  Simply click the  courses button in the blue global navigation bar, then select All Courses.  Click the +Course button at the top left,  select Manually Created Courses in the dropdown, and give your course a name.  This will create a “dummy” shell course in which you can create your content.  Once your district-associated course is created, you can copy your shell course modules and materials into the active course.  </p>

<h2 id="UDL">Universal Design for Learning: Barrier-free education for everyone</h2>
<hr>
<p>Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework that helps teachers plan and design learning encounters for all people. UDL assumes that any effort to provide struggling individual learners with better access to knowledge benefits ALL learners. UDL supports social constructivism theories by allowing additional learners access that expands the language and discussion surrounding a given topic. In this way, UDL may increase student acquisition of knowledge as well as expand the knowledge base surrounding any given topic.</p>
<h3>Increased Student Access</h3>
<p>UDL guidelines seek to increase student access to learning through the enhancement of three areas: engagement, representation, and action and expression. Providing students with multiple means of performing each of these learning actions provides them with additional means of accessing, building, and internalizing knowledge. These strategies can help students achieve the goal of becoming expert learners who are purposeful and motivated, resourceful and knowledgeable, and strategic and goal-oriented.</p>
<h3>The Why</h3>
<p>UDL encourages multiple means of engagement that develop affective networks or the “why” of learning. Teachers may provide students with greater access to learning, with options that recruit student interest. Once students access information, engagement that builds student learning supports options that sustain effort and persistence. Options for self-regulation provide students with additional pathways to internalize knowledge.</p>

</figure>
<h3>Multiple Means</h3>
<p>Multiple means of representation of ideas help students develop recognition networks or the “what” of learning. Options for perception or understanding provide students with multiple avenues to access information. Language and symbol options facilitate students as they build knowledge, and options surrounding student comprehension encourage student internalization.</p>
<h3>The How</h3>
<p>Additional avenues of Action and Expression encourage student strategic networks or the “how” of learning.&nbsp; UDL suggests physical action options enhance student access as they engage with learning tasks. Options for expression and communication provide students with additional pathways to build ideas, and options for executive functions such as goal setting and planning and development help students internalize new concepts.</p>
<h3>Learning For All</h3>
<p>Teachers who incorporate UDL guidelines into their curriculum flow provide ALL learners with additional access to learning. Check out the <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/">UDL Guidelines</a> as well as suggestions and tools for incorporating them at <a href="http://cast.org">Cast.org.</a></p>

You can release students from other teacher Hapara sessions by clicking the "Release All" button in "Browser Tabs." You can also release individual students by clicking the cinnamon bun symbol on their tabs listing.</p>
